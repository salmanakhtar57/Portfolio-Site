  introduction:
    "LikhSpire is a full-stack blog platform that allows users to create, manage, and explore blog posts. It was built as a capstone project during a full-stack development bootcamp, with a strong focus on backend systems and database design.",

  overview:
    "This project focuses on building a complete blogging system with authentication-like behavior, CRUD operations, and PostgreSQL integration. The frontend was designed using Bootstrap without templates to practice layout design and UI structuring.",
